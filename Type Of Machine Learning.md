Here are the type of machine learning

## 1. Supervised Learning
	Supervised learning are the type of machine learning that train model with data that have label given on it. each training data have known the input and output already. The purpose of supervised learning is to learn the connection or funtion that connect the input and the output. Model are now capable to create accurate prediction for new data that never been seen before.
	In supervised learning, input are the data with certain feature and the answer are the result or label that known by the data. Model learn from input and answer to develop rules or patterns that connect feature with result. this rules then use for predict the result of new data.

## 2. Unsupervised Learning
	Unsupervised learning involve model training using data that doesn't have label or result determined. This data only consist of features that describe the information without the information about the result should be.

The purpose of unsupervised learning are to identified pattern, structure, or relation that didn't seen through data. Model find it way to grouping, identifying, or decrease data dimension without explicit command about the determined result.

## 3. Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)
	Semi-supervised learning(SSL) are the approach in machine learning that erge element from supervised learning and supervised learning. in this methos, model train using data that consist of some labeled data and some unlabeled data. The main purpose of SSL are to utilize unlabeled data to increase model accuracy and minimize dependency from labeled data that might be limited.
## 4. Reinforcement learning
