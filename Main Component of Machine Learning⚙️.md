In machine learning, there are some main components that are important in the process of build the effective model. Each component play crucial role to make sure that the model not only accurate, but also can be relied in real time scenario.

Here are the explanation of each component:

## 1. Data
	Data are the most basic component in machine learning, without data, model cant be train and studied. Data consist of feature(attribute or feature input) and label
## 2. Algorithm
## 3. Model
## 4. Feature Engineering
## 5. Training
## 6. Evaluation
## 7. Hyperparameter Tuning
## 8. Deployment
