Previous [[Type Of Machine Learning]]

Stating problem in machine learning are the first step that are important and crucial in the process of model development. 

## Identify Purpose

We need to understand the objective we want to achieve by project. Without clear objective, we can losing direction  in model development.

### S.M.A.R.T Method
In Business, SMART are the effective way to make sure that the objective are clear, reachable, and relevant to company's strategy. SMART method are the abbreviation of *specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound*.
1. Specific
   The objective must be clear so that everyone that involve in the project understand what to achieve. The specific objective must be able to answer: (1)What we want to achieve? (2)Why it's important? (3)Who get involved? (4)When this objective will be achieved?
2. Measurable
   The objective must be measurable so that we can track the progress and know that the objective's target achieved. metric or performance indicator must declare to measure the progress.
3. Achievable
   The objective musts be realistic and achievable with the available resources.
4. Relevant
   The objective must be relevant with the whole business strategy and give significant contribution to company's long term achievement.
5. Time-Bound
   The objective must have the clear deadline to help stay focus and urgency feeling.

## Understand The Available Data
Observe the available data. The data must be enough to help achieve the objective.

1. Inventory Data
   Identifying all the data resource available, either internal or external are the first crucial step in the process of data analyse. Make sure to cover all the data received from company's internal system, like operational databases. By collecting all the relevant data, we make sure that none important information missed that could affect the data accuracy. This process also help in identifying the potential of data's gap and make a strategy to overcome it.
2. Evaluate Data's Quality
   Checking the data's completeness, consistency, accuracy, and relevancy. This step  
3. Data Exploration
4. Feature Choice
5. Cleaning and Transformation Data
