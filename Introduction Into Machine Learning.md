#MachineLearning 
_“A field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.”_ -Arthur Samuel, 1959-

The term *Machine Learning* get popularize by Arthur Samuel in 1959. He define Machine learning as a branch of knowledge about giving computer the ability to think, study, and develop it self. 

That mean, instead of writing code for every single task, we make machine to see through pattern from data and decide or predict based on its learning. This concept change our way to solve a problem.

[Here is the taxonomy of *artificial intelligent*](obsidian://open?vault=Machine_Learning&file=Assets%2Fai_taxonomy.jpeg)

1. Artificial Intelligent (AI)
   Artificial intelligent is the concept that fond all the branch of artificial intelligent. as the lowest tier, AI cover all the computer and machine usage to do task that require human intelligent like decision making, pattern  recognize, and problem solving.
   
2. Machine Learning (ML)
   Machine learning are the branch of AI, it was a ability of machine or computer to study from program without programmed explicitly. Machine learning technique enable computer to recognize pattern from data, make decision, take decision based on the information it get from experience and training data.
   
3. Neural Network (NN)
   Neural network are a mathematics model that inspired from human's nervous system. In machine learning context, NN use to proceed information and learn from data. This model consist of artificial neurons that connect each other inside layers that could learn abstract representation from data.
   
4. Deep Learning (DL)
   Deep learning are the sub-branch of ML that use NN with a lots of layers or *Deep Neuron Network* (DNN) to understand data representation that are abstract and complex. DL have make a huge improvement in various field like image classification, natural language processing, and another AI application.
   
5. Gen AI
   Generative AI is the branch of AI that focus on creating new content and original. Generative AI have the ability to create text, image, video, music, and another form of content that never been create before. It's different from traditional AI that operate based on procedure and data.

Before the concept of machine learning, human code a program explicitly, rule and paradigm of the early era of programming was represent in this diagram:

Traditional programming often have many flaw/limit. This system often rigid because depends on "if" and "else" rules to process and respond input.

Here are the example of traditional programming:

`if speed < 4:`
     `activity = walk`
`elif speed < 12:`
     `activity = run`
`else`
     `activity = stay`

The more complex activity we want to detect like playing basketball, this activity involve many movement like walk, run, jump, shoot, stop that are hard to explain in simple rules. This is where machine learning come as solution, machine learning given the ability o learn from data without writing rules manually.

Machine learning analyze data and find patterns that help detect what kind of activity. here are the diagram of machine learning:

In machine learning, we dealt with large number of data and label. Data are the information we have and use, and rules are information we want to predict or classified. with understanding the relation between data and label, we can make in use the machine learning to identify pattern in data.
